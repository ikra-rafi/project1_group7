## Group Name:
RAIJ _(RAGE)_: Because 4 women, 1 project... Yeah, we get it

## Description
An app to help decide what’s for lunch/dinner!!!

- You want to cook? We got recipes!
- You want to eat out? We got restaurants!
- You don’t know? Tell us what you’re in the mood for and we’ll give you both!

Foodastic is an application that allows users to search for recipes and restaurants. It features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.  It also includes 2 APIs to pull in information.  The [Spoonacular Food API](https://spoonacular.com/food-api) is used to retrieve recipes, and the [Yelp Fusion API](https://www.yelp.com/fusion) is used to retrieve restaurants.  The APIs are called via AJAX based on filter criteria input by the user.
